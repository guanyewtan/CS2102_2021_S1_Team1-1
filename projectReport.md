## 🧐 Application's data requirements and functionalities <a name = "application_description"></a>

## 🚀 Entity Relationship Model <a name = "er_diagram"></a>
**Insert the finalised diagram here**
**Also need to list down app constraints not captured by ER model**

## Database schema <a name = "schema"></a>
**Insert final schema.sql code here**
**Also need to list down app constraints not captured by schema aka the constraints reinforced by triggers**

## Normalization level of database <a name = "normalization"></a>
**3NF or CNF?**

## 🎉 Three non-trivial triggers used in the application <a name = "triggers"></a>
**Must show code and write description for each trigger**
Trigger to update the average rating of the caretaker and the number of reviews for the caretaker
Trigger to update the availability of the caretaker 
Trigger to update the employee/caretaker of the month

## 🎉 Three most complex queries implemented in apllication <a name = "queries"></a>
**Show code and write description**
A cool SQL query would be to aggregate the number of pets in each category (dog, cat, lizard)
and then compare it to the the number of caretakers that can take care od the different types of pets then the business can see what kind of caretakers they should advertise to join their website
(For example, there are more lizards then lizard caretakers so more lizard caretakers should be recruited)


## ⛏️ Tools and Frameworks used <a name = "tools_used"></a>
