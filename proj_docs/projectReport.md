## üßê Application's functionalities <a name = "application_description"></a>

Our web application, Pet Society, allows pet owners to search for caretakers who are able to take care of their pets, and apply for their services.
It can be viewed as a 'marketplace' for pet caring services. Here are the functions that different users have access to!

### Functions

Pet owners:

- Sign up for an account and register the pets that they want to find a caretaker to care for.
- Bid for a caretaker's services when he/she browses through the caretaker search page for their registered pets
- Search through all the available services offered. They can also the filter the results of their search using a few different parameters (average rating, availability date, area of the caretaker .etc)
- Edit the details of their profile on the profile page after they have signed up (e.g update their address and area, the pets they have .etc)
- Edit pet information, or delete a registered pet
- Submit a review for the caretaker on any completed service/transaction that they were involved in
- View all the past reviews and average rating of the caretaker when they are browsing the services offered
- Submit an enquiry to the administrators of thr website in the case of any doubts or disputes
- View the answers to the enquiries that they have previously submitted to the administrator
- View their past and current transactions. They can also filter their transactions based on its status (e.g completed, rejected, .etc)

Caretakers:

- Sign up for an account as either a full timer or part timer (but not both).
- Part timers are free to indicate their availability, there is no minimum number of days they are to be available every month
- Part timers can indicate the daily price for their periods of availability, and choose which bids they want to accept
- Full timers can take leave by indicating the period they want apply for, and the system will check if they are able to do so
- Full timers are entitled to an increase the price of their services if they perform well and achieve good ratings from pet owners
- Accept or reject bids offered by the pet owners for their services
- View the ratings and reviews that the caretakers have given them for the transactions they have been involved in
- View their expected salary for the current month
- View their past and current transactions. They can also filter their transactions based on its status (e.g accepted, rejected, completed .etc)

Administrators:

- View caretakers who are underperforming
- View the total number of jobs that have been completed/in progress for the month/year
- See the total earnings that the website has made through the commissions that it takes
- View the category of pets for which more caretakers are needed
- See the distribution of their users islandwide (split up by the five areas, Central, North, Northeast, East and West)
- View the total salary that needs to be paid to the caretakers every month
- See which caretakers they are managing (every caretaker is assigned to an administrator)
- See other relevant statistics in the admin dashboard
- Change the base price of the full time caretakers under their management

## üöÄ Entity Relationship Model <a name = "er_diagram"></a>

![Image of final ER diagram](/proj_docs/final_er_diagram.jpg)

Constraints not shown in ER diagram:

- **Duration_to** and **duration_from** of transaction_details must be IN BETWEEN the **service_avail_from** and **service_avail_to** attributes.
- All caretakers have a limit of up to 5 Pets at any one time.
  - Full time caretakers and part time caretakers with a rating of 4/5 and higher can only participate in 5 transactions at any given time. In the ER diagram, this means that the number of transactions which have a t_status = 3 at any point in time <= 5. This constraint is enforced by a SQL Trigger.
  - Part time caretakers with a rating lower than a 4/5 can only participate in 2 transactions at any point in time. In the ER diagram, this means that the number of transactions which have a t_status = 4 at any point in time <= 2. This constraint is enforced by a SQL Trigger.
- A full time caretaker must work for a minimum of 2 x 150 consecutive days a year AND a full time caretaker is treated as available until they apply for leave. These constraints are enforced by a check performed by a SQL Function.
- A full time caretakers cannot apply for leave if there is at least one Pet under their care. This constraint is enforced by a check performed by a SQL Function.
- A caretaker should not take care of pets they cannot care for. This constraint is enforced by the foreign key in Transactions_Details onto Offers_Services.
- The daily price for a full time caretaker increases with the rating of the caretaker but will never be below the base price. This constraint is enforced by a SQL Trigger "update_fulltime_price".

## Database schema <a name = "schema"></a>

The constraints that cannot be enforced using table constraints/checks are enforced using SQL Triggers.
The primary and foreign keys of the tables are indicated in the creation of each table.

## Normalization level of database <a name = "normalization"></a>

<!-- 3NF or BCNF -->

All our tables are in BCNF format to eliminate data redundancies and anomalies.

## üéâ Three non-trivial triggers used in the application <a name = "triggers"></a>

#### Trigger to update the average rating of the caretaker and the number of reviews for the caretaker after every new review submission by a pet owner

This trigger is executed every time a new review is submitted by a pet owner for a transaction that is complete.

First, it will count the number of reviews that the caretaker has in the Transactions_details table and the **no_of_reviews** attribute
of the caretaker in the Caretakers table will be updated accordingly.

Then, it will compute the average of all the ratings that the caretaker has received from the pet owners and the **avg_rating** attribute
of the caretaker in the Caretakers table will be updated accordingly.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_caretaker_rating
	AFTER UPDATE ON Transactions_Details
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE FUNCTION update_caretaker_rating();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_caretaker_rating()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
	DECLARE
		rating NUMERIC := 0;
		reviews_num INTEGER := 0;
	BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(owner_rating) INTO reviews_num
	FROM Transactions_Details
	WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
	IF (reviews_num > 0) THEN
		SELECT AVG(owner_rating) INTO rating
		FROM Transactions_Details
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
	END IF;

	UPDATE Caretakers
	SET avg_rating = rating,
	no_of_reviews = reviews_num
    WHERE (caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email);

	RETURN NULL;
 	END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Trigger to check whether the caretaker has already reached the maximum amount of pets he can care for when he accepts a bid by a pet owner

This trigger is implemented to ensure that a caretaker does not exceed the maximum number of pets that he can take care for.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_caretaker_limit
	BEFORE UPDATE ON Transactions_Details
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_caretaker_limit();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_caretaker_limit()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
	DECLARE
		date_start DATE := NEW.duration_from;
		date_end DATE := NEW.duration_to;
		emp_type VARCHAR := NEW.employment_type;
		rating NUMERIC;
		pet_limit INTEGER := 2;
		count BIGINT := 0;
	BEGIN
		-- if the status change is to 2 (reject), 4(complete), 5(review submitted),
		-- the checks do not need to be performed.
		IF (NEW.t_status = 2 OR NEW.t_status = 4 OR NEW.t_status = 5) THEN
			RETURN NEW;
		END IF;

		-- the code below will execute only when the caretaker is about to accept a bid
		-- get rating of caretaker
		SELECT avg_rating INTO rating
		FROM Caretakers
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;

		-- for a full time caretaker or a part time caretaker with a rating >= 4, the limit is 5
		IF ((emp_type = 'parttime' AND rating >= 4) OR emp_type = 'fulltime') THEN
			pet_limit := 5;
		END IF;

		-- Loop over the each date of the new bid to be accepted and check if any of the days have
		-- more than 5 transactions in progress
		WHILE date_start <= date_end LOOP
			-- select all the transactions that are also in the same availability period as the transaction
			-- to be accepted and check if they amount to 5
			SELECT COUNT(*) INTO count
			FROM Transactions_Details
			WHERE (caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email
			AND service_avail_from = NEW.service_avail_from
			AND service_avail_to = NEW.service_avail_to AND t_status = 3
			AND date_start >= duration_from AND date_start <= duration_to);

			IF (count >= pet_limit AND NEW.t_status = 3) THEN
				RAISE EXCEPTION 'You have already reached the limit for the number of pets you can take care of!';
				RETURN NULL;
			END IF;
			date_start := date_start + 1;
		END LOOP;

		RETURN NEW;
 	END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

##### Trigger to update the daily price of a full time caretaker's services when his rating is updated after every new review submission

This trigger will execute to enable the feature that a 'full time caretaker's price for his services will increase as his rating increases'

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_fulltime_price
	AFTER UPDATE OF avg_rating ON Caretakers
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_fulltime_price();

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_fulltime_price()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
	DECLARE
		emp_type VARCHAR := NEW.employment_type;
		rating NUMERIC;
		reviews INTEGER;
		new_price INTEGER := 50;
	BEGIN
		-- get rating of caretaker
		SELECT avg_rating, no_of_reviews INTO rating, reviews
		FROM Caretakers
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
		IF (emp_type = 'fulltime' AND reviews >= 10) THEN
			IF (rating > 4.2 AND rating < 4.4 ) THEN
				new_price := 52;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.2 AND rating < 4.4 ) THEN
				new_price := 55;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.4 AND rating < 4.6 ) THEN
				new_price := 59;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.6 AND rating < 4.8 ) THEN
				new_price := 64;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.8 ) THEN
				new_price := 70;
			END IF;
		END IF;
		EXECUTE 'UPDATE Manages SET base_price = $1 WHERE caretaker_email = $2' USING new_price, NEW.caretaker_email;
		EXECUTE 'UPDATE Offers_Services SET daily_price = $1 WHERE caretaker_email = $2' USING new_price, NEW.caretaker_email;
		RETURN NEW;
 	END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

## üéâ Three most complex queries implemented in apllication <a name = "queries"></a>

**Show code and write description**
A cool SQL query would be to aggregate the number of pets in each category (dog, cat, lizard)
and then compare it to the the number of caretakers that can take care of the different types of pets then the business can see what kind of caretakers they should advertise to join their website
(For example, there are more lizards then lizard caretakers so more lizard caretakers should be recruited)

### Advanced SQL Functions used

##### Function calculates the total commission earned by a pcsadmin

This function will returns the pcs admin email and the total commission earned. Detailed explanation of the sql query can be found in the comments within the code block.

```sql
-- function calculates total commission earned by admin inserted in $1
-- returns admin email and the sum of all the commissions earned
SELECT m1.admin_email, SUM(m2.commission)
  FROM pcsadmins AS m1, (SELECT m.admin_email AS admin_email, td.caretaker_email as caretaker_email,
                                -- calculates the commission earned from a single transaction
								-- takes the date difference multipled by cost and 25%
                                td.cost*SUM(td.duration_to::date-td.duration_from::date+1)*0.25 AS commission
						   -- commission earned if the caretaker is being managed by the pcsadmin
                           FROM manages m JOIN transactions_details td ON m.caretaker_email=td.caretaker_email
						   -- commission earned if employment type is part-time
                           WHERE td.employment_type='parttime'
						   -- commission earned if the transaction is accepted, completed or reviewed
						   AND td.t_status>= 3
						-- grouped to get the aggregate
                        GROUP BY m.admin_email, td.caretaker_email, td.cost, td.duration_from, td.duration_to) AS m2
 WHERE m1.admin_email=m2.admin_email AND m1.admin_email=$1
-- grouped to get the aggregate
GROUP BY m1.admin_email
```

##### Function checks if full time caretaker can leave

This function will return a table containing all new_service_avail_from1, new_service_avail_to1, new_service_avail_from2 new_service_avail_to2, leave_duration. Detailed explanation of the sql function can be found in the comments within the code block.

```sql

## üèÅ Summary of difficulties encountered and lessons learned from project <a name = "conclusion"></a>

- Leveraging the power of DBMS to make the application fast and efficient was a problem faced in the early stages of our project. After we realised the importance of normalisation as we saw certain redundancies that appeared in our database, we were able to remove some redundant tables. This showed us the importance of a proper ER diagram.
- With careful planning at the start, we could have avoided some issues due to data parsing. In our initial implementation, we stored durations in our database as a string, with start and end dates concatenation together and delimited by a comma. We faced difficulties parsing the string into dates for calculations, and had to re-implement our schema halfway through the project to store dates as DATE format in the database instead.
- Creating complex queries was challenging with the knowledge and SQL constructs exposed to us from the module and we had to search online for methods to achieve what we want. We were able to find better ways to make our existing queries better and more efficient, such as the usage of LOOP in a PLPGSQL triggers/functions. We were able to make efficient queries with the usage of SQL transactions as well.
- Lack of experience in the field of web developement technologies, such as React and NodeJS posed an initial steep learning curve for some of the group members to keep up with the overall development pace of the team.
- Splitting the workload was a problem faced throughout the project, as progress can be slow without consistent meetings and sprints. Developement could be more efficient with better allocation of task, as well as a issue/task tracker.
