![Image of final ER diagram](https://i.ibb.co/qYYvRHM/ER-diagram-img.jpg)

Constraints not shown in ER diagram:
- Duration_to and duration_from of transaction_details must be in between the service_avail_from and service_avail_to attributes


## Database schema <a name = "schema"></a>
**Insert final schema.sql code here**
**Also need to list down app constraints not captured by schema aka the constraints reinforced by triggers**

## Normalization level of database <a name = "normalization"></a>
<!-- 3NF or BCNF -->
All our tables are in BCNF format to eliminate data redundancies and anomalies.


## üéâ Three non-trivial triggers used in the application <a name = "triggers"></a>
**Must show code and write description for each trigger**
#### Trigger to update the average rating of the caretaker and the number of reviews for the caretaker after every new review submission by a pet owner
```sql
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ 
	DECLARE 
		rating NUMERIC := 0;
		reviews_num INTEGER := 0;
	BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(owner_rating) INTO reviews_num
	FROM Transactions_Details
	WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
	IF (reviews_num > 0) THEN
		SELECT AVG(owner_rating) INTO rating
		FROM Transactions_Details
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
	END IF;
	
	UPDATE Caretakers 
	SET avg_rating = rating,
	no_of_reviews = reviews_num
    WHERE (caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email);
	
	RETURN NULL;
 	END; 
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_caretaker_rating
	AFTER UPDATE ON Transactions_Details
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE FUNCTION update_caretaker_rating();
```

#### Trigger to check whether the caretaker has already reached the maximum amount of pets he can care for when he accepts a bid by a pet owner
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_caretaker_limit()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ 
	DECLARE 
		date_start DATE := NEW.duration_from;
		date_end DATE := NEW.duration_to;
		emp_type VARCHAR := NEW.employment_type;
		rating NUMERIC;
		pet_limit INTEGER := 2;
		count BIGINT := 0;
	BEGIN
		-- get rating of caretaker
		SELECT avg_rating INTO rating
		FROM Caretakers
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
		IF ((emp_type = 'parttime' AND rating > 4) OR emp_type = 'fulltime') THEN
			pet_limit := 5;
		END IF;
		-- Loop over the each date of the new bid to be accepted and check if any of the days have
		-- more than 5 transactions in progress
		WHILE date_start <= date_end LOOP
			-- select all the transactions that are also in the same availability period as the transaction
			-- to be accepted and check if they amount to 5
			SELECT COUNT(*) INTO count
			FROM Transactions_Details
			WHERE (caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email 
			AND service_avail_from = NEW.service_avail_from
			AND service_avail_to = NEW.service_avail_to AND t_status = 3 
			AND date_start >= duration_from AND date_start <= duration_to);
			
			IF (count >= pet_limit AND NEW.t_status = 3) THEN
				RAISE EXCEPTION 'You have already reached the limit for the number of pets you can take care of!';
				RETURN NULL;
			END IF;
			date_start := date_start + 1;
		END LOOP;
		
		RETURN NEW;
 	END; 
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER check_caretaker_limit
	BEFORE UPDATE ON Transactions_Details
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_caretaker_limit();
```

##### Trigger to update the daily price of a full time caretaker's services when his rating is updated after every new review submission
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_fulltime_price()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ 
	DECLARE 
		emp_type VARCHAR := NEW.employment_type;
		rating NUMERIC;
		new_price INTEGER := 50;
	BEGIN
		-- get rating of caretaker
		SELECT avg_rating INTO rating
		FROM Caretakers
		WHERE caretaker_email = NEW.caretaker_email;
		IF (emp_type = 'fulltime') THEN
			IF (rating > 4.2 AND rating < 4.4 ) THEN
				new_price := 52;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.2 AND rating < 4.4 ) THEN
				new_price := 55;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.4 AND rating < 4.6 ) THEN
				new_price := 59;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.6 AND rating < 4.8 ) THEN
				new_price := 64;
			ELSIF (rating > 4.8 ) THEN
				new_price := 70;
			END IF;
		END IF;
		EXECUTE 'UPDATE Manages SET base_price = $1 WHERE caretaker_email = $2' USING new_price, NEW.caretaker_email;
		EXECUTE 'UPDATE Offers_Services SET daily_price = $1 WHERE caretaker_email = $2' USING new_price, NEW.caretaker_email;
		RETURN NEW;
 	END; 
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_fulltime_price
	AFTER UPDATE OF avg_rating ON Caretakers
	FOR EACH ROW
	EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_fulltime_price();
```


## üéâ Three most complex queries implemented in apllication <a name = "queries"></a>
**Show code and write description**
A cool SQL query would be to aggregate the number of pets in each category (dog, cat, lizard)
and then compare it to the the number of caretakers that can take care od the different types of pets then the business can see what kind of caretakers they should advertise to join their website
(For example, there are more lizards then lizard caretakers so more lizard caretakers should be recruited)

### Advanced SQL Functions used

      	USING assigned_admin, input_email;
